# Statitstical-Learning-Method
I want to implement all the algorithms introduced by 统计学习方法, 李航

# Feature

- **Matrix calculation**.
Strip off from loops. Implement most of the algorithms with matrix calculation supported by `numpy`.
- **Extensible**.
It is easy to fit the codes with new datasets because all the algorithms are controllable through parameters, to a large extent.

# Dependencies

- Python3
- numpy
- matplotlib
- [rich](https://github.com/willmcgugan/rich)
