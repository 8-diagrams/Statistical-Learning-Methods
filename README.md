# Statistical-Learning-Method
I want to implement all the algorithms introduced by 统计学习方法, 李航

# Feature

- **Detailed**
All the algorithms introduced by the book is implemented thoroughly. I try my best not to skip any detail.
- **Matrix calculation**.
Strip off `for` loops. Implement most of the algorithms with matrix calculation supported by `numpy`.
- **Extensible**.
It is easy to fit the codes with new datasets because all the algorithms are controllable through parameters, to a large extent.

# Dependencies

- Python3
- numpy
- matplotlib
- [rich](https://github.com/willmcgugan/rich)

# Usage

Just run any single file located in each chapter. You will see examples of the algorithm.
